  # Action Controllers are the core of a web request in Rails. They are made up of one or more actions that are executed
  # on request and then either render a template or redirect to another action. An action is defined as a public method
  # on the controller, which will automatically be made accessible to the web-server through Rails Routes.
  #
  # A sample controller could look like this:
  #
  #   class GuestBookController < ActionController::Base
  #     def index
  #       @entries = Entry.find(:all)
  #     end
  #
  #     def sign
  #       Entry.create(params[:entry])
  #       redirect_to :action => "index"
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Actions, by default, render a template in the <tt>app/views</tt> directory corresponding to the name of the controller and action
  # after executing code in the action. For example, the +index+ action of the GuestBookController would render the
  # template <tt>app/views/guestbook/index.erb</tt> by default after populating the <tt>@entries</tt> instance variable.
  #
  # Unlike index, the sign action will not render a template. After performing its main purpose (creating a
  # new entry in the guest book), it initiates a redirect instead. This redirect works by returning an external
  # "302 Moved" HTTP response that takes the user to the index action.
  #
  # The index and sign represent the two basic action archetypes used in Action Controllers. Get-and-show and do-and-redirect.
  # Most actions are variations of these themes.
  #
  # == Requests
  #
  # Requests are processed by the Action Controller framework by extracting the value of the "action" key in the request parameters.
  # This value should hold the name of the action to be performed. Once the action has been identified, the remaining
  # request parameters, the session (if one is available), and the full request with all the HTTP headers are made available to
  # the action through instance variables. Then the action is performed.
  #
  # The full request object is available with the request accessor and is primarily used to query for HTTP headers. These queries
  # are made by accessing the environment hash, like this:
  #
  #   def server_ip
  #     location = request.env["SERVER_ADDR"]
  #     render :text => "This server hosted at #{location}"
  #   end
  #
  # == Parameters
  #
  # All request parameters, whether they come from a GET or POST request, or from the URL, are available through the params method
  # which returns a hash. For example, an action that was performed through <tt>/weblog/list?category=All&limit=5</tt> will include
  # <tt>{ "category" => "All", "limit" => 5 }</tt> in params.
  #
  # It's also possible to construct multi-dimensional parameter hashes by specifying keys using brackets, such as:
  #
  #   <input type="text" name="post[name]" value="david">
  #   <input type="text" name="post[address]" value="hyacintvej">
  #
  # A request stemming from a form holding these inputs will include <tt>{ "post" => { "name" => "david", "address" => "hyacintvej" } }</tt>.
  # If the address input had been named "post[address][street]", the params would have included
  # <tt>{ "post" => { "address" => { "street" => "hyacintvej" } } }</tt>. There's no limit to the depth of the nesting.
  #
  # == Sessions
  #
  # Sessions allows you to store objects in between requests. This is useful for objects that are not yet ready to be persisted,
  # such as a Signup object constructed in a multi-paged process, or objects that don't change much and are needed all the time, such
  # as a User object for a system that requires login. The session should not be used, however, as a cache for objects where it's likely
  # they could be changed unknowingly. It's usually too much work to keep it all synchronized -- something databases already excel at.
  #
  # You can place objects in the session by using the <tt>session</tt> method, which accesses a hash:
  #
  #   session[:person] = Person.authenticate(user_name, password)
  #
  # And retrieved again through the same hash:
  #
  #   Hello #{session[:person]}
  #
  # For removing objects from the session, you can either assign a single key to +nil+:
  #
  #   # removes :person from session
  #   session[:person] = nil
  #
  # or you can remove the entire session with +reset_session+.
  #
  # Sessions are stored by default in a browser cookie that's cryptographically signed, but unencrypted.
  # This prevents the user from tampering with the session but also allows him to see its contents.
  #
  # Do not put secret information in cookie-based sessions!
  #
  # Other options for session storage are:
  #
  # * ActiveRecord::SessionStore - Sessions are stored in your database, which works better than PStore with multiple app servers and,
  #   unlike CookieStore, hides your session contents from the user. To use ActiveRecord::SessionStore, set
  #
  #     config.action_controller.session_store = :active_record_store
  #
  #   in your <tt>config/environment.rb</tt> and run <tt>rake db:sessions:create</tt>.
  #
  # * MemCacheStore - Sessions are stored as entries in your memcached cache.
  #   Set the session store type in <tt>config/environment.rb</tt>:
  #
  #     config.action_controller.session_store = :mem_cache_store
  #
  #   This assumes that memcached has been installed and configured properly.
  #   See the MemCacheStore docs for more information.
  #
  # == Responses
  #
  # Each action results in a response, which holds the headers and document to be sent to the user's browser. The actual response
  # object is generated automatically through the use of renders and redirects and requires no user intervention.
  #
  # == Renders
  #
  # Action Controller sends content to the user by using one of five rendering methods. The most versatile and common is the rendering
  # of a template. Included in the Action Pack is the Action View, which enables rendering of ERb templates. It's automatically configured.
  # The controller passes objects to the view by assigning instance variables:
  #
  #   def show
  #     @post = Post.find(params[:id])
  #   end
  #
  # Which are then automatically available to the view:
  #
  #   Title: <%= @post.title %>
  #
  # You don't have to rely on the automated rendering. Especially actions that could result in the rendering of different templates will use
  # the manual rendering methods:
  #
  #   def search
  #     @results = Search.find(params[:query])
  #     case @results
  #       when 0 then render :action => "no_results"
  #       when 1 then render :action => "show"
  #       when 2..10 then render :action => "show_many"
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Read more about writing ERb and Builder templates in link:classes/ActionView/Base.html.
  #
  # == Redirects
  #
  # Redirects are used to move from one action to another. For example, after a <tt>create</tt> action, which stores a blog entry to a database,
  # we might like to show the user the new entry. Because we're following good DRY principles (Don't Repeat Yourself), we're going to reuse (and redirect to)
  # a <tt>show</tt> action that we'll assume has already been created. The code might look like this:
  #
  #   def create
  #     @entry = Entry.new(params[:entry])
  #     if @entry.save
  #       # The entry was saved correctly, redirect to show
  #       redirect_to :action => 'show', :id => @entry.id
  #     else
  #       # things didn't go so well, do something else
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # In this case, after saving our new entry to the database, the user is redirected to the <tt>show</tt> method which is then executed.
  #
  # == Calling multiple redirects or renders
  #
  # An action may contain only a single render or a single redirect. Attempting to try to do either again will result in a DoubleRenderError:
  #
  #   def do_something
  #     redirect_to :action => "elsewhere"
  #     render :action => "overthere" # raises DoubleRenderError
  #   end
  #
  # If you need to redirect on the condition of something, then be sure to add "and return" to halt execution.
  #
  #   def do_something
  #     redirect_to(:action => "elsewhere") and return if monkeys.nil?
  #     render :action => "overthere" # won't be called if monkeys is nil
  #   end

      #   <tt>url_for :controller => 'posts', :action => 'show', :id => 10, :anchor => 'comments'</tt>
      #   will produce "/posts/show/10#comments".
      # * <tt>:only_path</tt> - If true, returns the relative URL (omitting the protocol, host name, and port) (<tt>false</tt> by default).
      # * <tt>:trailing_slash</tt> - If true, adds a trailing slash, as in "/archive/2005/". Note that this
      #   is currently not recommended since it breaks caching.
      # * <tt>:host</tt> - Overrides the default (current) host if provided.
      # * <tt>:protocol</tt> - Overrides the default (current) protocol if provided.
      # * <tt>:port</tt> - Optionally specify the port to connect to.
      # * <tt>:user</tt> - Inline HTTP authentication (only plucked out if <tt>:password</tt> is also present).
      # * <tt>:password</tt> - Inline HTTP authentication (only plucked out if <tt>:user</tt> is also present).
      # * <tt>:skip_relative_url_root</tt> - If true, the url is not constructed using the +relative_url_root+
      #   of the request so the path will include the web server relative installation directory.
      #
      # The URL is generated from the remaining keys in the hash. A URL contains two key parts: the <base> and a query string.
      # Routes composes a query string as the key/value pairs not included in the <base>.
      #
      # The default Routes setup supports a typical Rails path of "controller/action/id" where action and id are optional, with
      # action defaulting to 'index' when not given. Here are some typical url_for statements and their corresponding URLs:
      #
      #   url_for :controller => 'posts', :action => 'recent'                # => 'proto://host.com/posts/recent'
      #   url_for :controller => 'posts', :action => 'index'                 # => 'proto://host.com/posts'
      #   url_for :controller => 'posts', :action => 'index', :port=>'8033'  # => 'proto://host.com:8033/posts'
      #   url_for :controller => 'posts', :action => 'show', :id => 10       # => 'proto://host.com/posts/show/10'
      #   url_for :controller => 'posts', :user => 'd', :password => '123'   # => 'proto://d:123@host.com/posts'
      #
      # When generating a new URL, missing values may be filled in from the current request's parameters. For example,
      # <tt>url_for :action => 'some_action'</tt> will retain the current controller, as expected. This behavior extends to
      # other parameters, including <tt>:controller</tt>, <tt>:id</tt>, and any other parameters that are placed into a Route's
      # path.
      #  
      # The URL helpers such as <tt>url_for</tt> have a limited form of memory: when generating a new URL, they can look for
      # missing values in the current request's parameters. Routes attempts to guess when a value should and should not be
      # taken from the defaults. There are a few simple rules on how this is performed:
      #
      # * If the controller name begins with a slash no defaults are used:
      #
      #     url_for :controller => '/home'
      #
      #   In particular, a leading slash ensures no namespace is assumed. Thus,
      #   while <tt>url_for :controller => 'users'</tt> may resolve to
      #   <tt>Admin::UsersController</tt> if the current controller lives under
      #   that module, <tt>url_for :controller => '/users'</tt> ensures you link
      #   to <tt>::UsersController</tt> no matter what.
      # * If the controller changes, the action will default to index unless provided
      #
      # The final rule is applied while the URL is being generated and is best illustrated by an example. Let us consider the
      # route given by <tt>map.connect 'people/:last/:first/:action', :action => 'bio', :controller => 'people'</tt>.
      #
      # Suppose that the current URL is "people/hh/david/contacts". Let's consider a few different cases of URLs which are generated
      # from this page.
      #
      # * <tt>url_for :action => 'bio'</tt> -- During the generation of this URL, default values will be used for the first and
      # last components, and the action shall change. The generated URL will be, "people/hh/david/bio".
      # * <tt>url_for :first => 'davids-little-brother'</tt> This generates the URL 'people/hh/davids-little-brother' -- note
      #   that this URL leaves out the assumed action of 'bio'.
      #
      # However, you might ask why the action from the current request, 'contacts', isn't carried over into the new URL. The
      # answer has to do with the order in which the parameters appear in the generated path. In a nutshell, since the
      # value that appears in the slot for <tt>:first</tt> is not equal to default value for <tt>:first</tt> we stop using
      # defaults. On its own, this rule can account for much of the typical Rails URL behavior.
      #  
      # Although a convenience, defaults can occasionally get in your way. In some cases a default persists longer than desired.
      # The default may be cleared by adding <tt>:name => nil</tt> to <tt>url_for</tt>'s options.
      # This is often required when writing form helpers, since the defaults in play may vary greatly depending upon where the
      # helper is used from. The following line will redirect to PostController's default action, regardless of the page it is
      # displayed on:
      #
      #   url_for :controller => 'posts', :action => nil
      #
      # If you explicitly want to create a URL that's almost the same as the current URL, you can do so using the
      # <tt>:overwrite_params</tt> options. Say for your posts you have different views for showing and printing them.
      # Then, in the show view, you get the URL for the print view like this
      #
      #   url_for :overwrite_params => { :action => 'print' }
      #
      # This takes the current URL as is and only exchanges the action. In contrast, <tt>url_for :action => 'print'</tt>
      # would have slashed-off the path components after the changed action.
