	The most reliable method is to use the 3-letter code on your boarding pass.
	Alternatively, you can enter any string containing the word "airport" and
	we will try to find the right airport code for you.  For example, to
	set your location to Chicago O'Hare Airport, you can use of the
	following names:
</p>

<ul class='section'>
	<li>ORD</li>
	<li>Chicago O'Hare airport</li>
	<li>o'hare airport</li>
	<li>airport o hare</li>
	<li>ohare airport</li>
</ul>

<p class='section'>
	Before checking against the following list, the text you enter is
	converted to lowercase, and all punctuation (except spaces) is removed,
	as are the words 'municipal', 'regional', 'international', and 'airport.'
	If you think we should add an alias, please
	<a href='mailto:support@seek-you.com'>email</a> us.
